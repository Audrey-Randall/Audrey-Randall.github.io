            <h3>About Me</h3>
            I am a PhD student at the University of California San Diego (UCSD), working with Aaron Schulman, Geoff Voelker, and Stefan Savage. 
            <h4>Research Interests</h4>
            Internet Measurement    |   Security    |   Privacy |   Networking

            <h3>Current Projects</h3>
			
            <h4>DNS Interception</h4>
            While working on Trufflehunter, we discovered that some of our queries were getting intercepted
            before they could arrive at the resolver we sent them to. Furthermore, the responses we received were 
            spoofed to look like they had come from the query's original destination. The responses were not 
            otherwise changed: this interception is transparent from the point of view of the users. Upon
            investigation, we discovered the culprit: our own Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), also known as
            a home router. We conducted a measurement study to find out if this interception happens anywhere else,
            and if so, where in the network the interceptors are located. Our results were published at IMC 2021 in
            a short paper entitled <a href="https://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/~voelker/pubs/homejack-imc21.pdf"><em>Home is Where the Hijacking Is: Understanding DNS Interception by Residential Routers.</em></a>

            <h4>Bounce Tracking</h4>
            Some browsers, such as Safari, Firefox, and Brave, are moving towards blocking
            third-party tracking cookies by default. Trackers have responded by developing
            new techniques for tracking users between websites. For example, say a tracker
            wishes to track a user from website A to website B. The tracker can manipulate the link
            on A that points to B, by stuffing a user identifier into a 
            query parameter in the link when it is clicked. The tracker could also redirect
            the link: instead of taking the user directly to site B, the link redirects from site A
            to site "track.com" to site B. Visiting "track.com" as a top level frame allows 
            the tracker to set a cookie in a first party context. This redirection-based technique is called
            "bounce tracking." During an internship with <a href="https://brave.com/"><em>Brave Software</em></a>, we 
            crawled the web to measure the prevalence of bounce tracking and query stuffing. 
            This work is currently ongoing.

            <h4>Blockchain DNS</h4>
            Traditional DNS relies on centralized entities (registries and registrars) that control
            who can purchase domain names. These entities have the power to remove domain names from
            zone files and prevent them from being accessed. Due to a perception that this power 
            can lead to censorship, "blockchain DNS" has arisen as a censorship-proof alternative
            to traditional DNS. In blockchain DNS, DNS records are stored within various blockchains,
            which means no central organization has the ability to remove them. Unfortunately,
            this arrangement has proven attractive to malware authors, who use blockchain DNS to record
            the records of their command and control servers. By some estimates, the majority of
            domains in some DNS-supporting blockchains are associated with malware. We intend to study this ecosystem and
            present possible solutions to the rampant abuse. This work is ongoing.

            <h3>Selected Past Projects</h3> 

			<h4>Trufflehunter</h4>
			Certain phenomena on the Internet, such as the prevalence of 
            stalkerware, contract cheating services, or phishing domains, are 
            difficult to measure because of their sensitive and rare natures. However, 
            all of these phenomena are visible within the Domain Name System. With the 
            rise of public DNS resolvers such as Google Public DNS, Cloudflare DNS
            OpenDNS, and Quad9, a new opportunity has arisen to study the 
            prevalence of such occurrences using DNS cache sniffing. Cache sniffing on 
            public resolvers, in contrast to previous work published on small, 
            misconfigured open resolvers, can yield far more information, while at the 
            same time preserving privacy. However, public resolvers have complex and 
            unique caching behaviors that also make cache sniffing far more difficult. 
            We studied the caching strategies of four public DNS resolvers and 
            present a method for using DNS cache sniffing on each of them. We then built a tool, <b>Trufflehunter</b>, to
            estimate the popularity of the aforementioned applications, which is difficult to measure by other means. This work was published at IMC 2020.

			<h4>Network Hygiene</h4>
			Common security advice includes injunctions such as "Update your operating system," "run antivirus," and "change your passwords frequently."
			However, there isn't much information available about if this advice actually lowers a user's chances of getting infected by malware.
			Working with a unique network vantage point, we measured the correlations between user behaviors and infection rates
			to see what behavioral factors are actually likely to get you owned online. This work was published at IMC 2019.

			<!-- <h4>Censorship Circumvention in China</h4>
			I worked with Prof. Eric Wustrow at University of Colorado Boulder to create a tool called Metis that could predict which websites a user visited were likely
			 to be censored, so that it could route only those websites through a censorship circumvention tool, and connect to the others directly.  
			 The idea was that circumvention tools are usually slow, because they connect to EVERY website through circuitous routes, not just the ones that
			  would get blocked. 
			 Metis could also collect aggregate information about which websites were blocked, to give the research community a better idea of which sites
			 get censored where. I implemented differential privacy (Google's RAPPOR) to protect user privacy. This project was never deployed, but I 
			 learned a lot in the process. -->
